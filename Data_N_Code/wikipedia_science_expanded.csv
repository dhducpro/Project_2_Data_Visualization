They supplied the rapidly growing, both in size and number, museums and educational establishments and private collectors whose collections, either in entirety or parts finally enteredmuseums.
Most sold not justzoological,botanicalandgeologicalspecimens but also 
equipment and books. Many also soldarchaeologicalandethnographicitems. They purchased 
specimens from professional and amateur collectors, sometimes collected themselves as well as acting as agents for the sale of 
collections. Many were based inmercantilecentres notablyAmsterdam,Hamburg, andLondonor 
in major cities. Some were specialists and some weretaxonomicauthorities who wrote scientific works and manuals, some functioned as trading museums or institutes.",Natural history;Business-related lists,1,230,15 May 2025,152,8,3,3,2025

Science on Tap,"Science on Tapis the social-cultural initiative of Yivsam Azgad, head of the Media Department and artcuratorof theWeizmann Institute of Sciencein Rehovot, Israel. 
The project began in 2010, under the titleBeer,Science, and Fun, as a gesture to the city ofRehovoton its 120th anniversary.[1][2]In this framework, some 35 scientists and graduate students went to bars andpubsin Rehovot to talk with the patrons about open questions in science and the newest advances on the forefront of global science. On the same night, research students went to the city center and led a “science comics” session for children in which they created their own science comics, inspired by the Nano Comics series[3]put out by the Weizmann Institute of Science and edited by Yivsam Azgad. 
This initiative was highly successful and was covered by the media inIsraeland the world. The scientists, artists, and politicians posed a challenge to the organizers: To reproduce this success inTel Aviv. 
In response to the challenge, Azgad decided, with the support of the Weizmann Institute of Science president,Prof. Daniel Zajfman, to organize the event in Tel Aviv under a new name: Science on Tap. This event, preceded by a creative ad campaign, included the participation of 70 scientists from the Weizmann Institute of Science speaking in different bars, all at the same time, with free entrance for all. The wild success of this venture led to a significant change in the entertainment culture in Tel Aviv in particular and in Israel in general. Dozens of similar projects, all with the “on Tap” format, (Doctors on Tap, Law on Tap, Knesset Members on Tap, Stock Market on Tap, etc.) were introduced. Similar events have also been put on inLondon,Boston,Panama Cityand other places around the world. 
Science on Tap is an annual event in Tel Aviv[4]and is conducted jointly by the Weizmann Institute of Science,Time OutTel Aviv magazine,[5][6]and often the Tel Aviv municipality. It remains the largest event of its kind.[7][8]",Science festivals;Science education;Science in society;Public sphere;Popular science,8,38,22 September 2024,344,2,1,8,2024

There are also analytical replicates which is when an exact copy of a sample is analyzed, such as a cell, organism or molecule, using exactly the same procedure. This is done in order to check for analytical error. In the absence of this type of error replicates should yield the same result.

A tower testing station consists of two steel stands and one or more foundations, on which a sample of the tower can be built. The number of test conditions is normally limited to between six and eight individual cases, with loading condition such as reduced wind and ice. The towers to be tested are erected on rigid foundation and the wire ropes attached to the loading point required. Loading may either be applied by 'dead' weights using scale pans, winches or hydraulic rams. In the latter cases a load cell or dynamometer is placed in the rigging adjacent to the point of loading at the structure. The loading methods induce strain by pulling cables away from the tower to the specified loads. The pulling load is indicated through astrain gaugeplaced on the pulling point.

In its modern usage, a kymograph is typically a space–time plot used in fields such as microscopy, cell biology, and speech science to track dynamic processes. These plots are generated by extracting intensity values along a predefined path across sequential image frames. The resulting image reduces the dimension to show time on one axis and sequential spatial information on the other. Using this technique allows for the visualization of dynamics within the image sequence, often by measuring the resulting slope of lines or streaks. This allows researchers to quantify velocity and directionality of movement, especially in applications like mitochondrial transport, vesicle trafficking, or vocal fold vibration. Although they reduce spatial information to a one-dimensional line, kymographs offer high temporal resolution and are often used alongside or in place of particle tracking techniques.",Medical imaging;Scientific techniques;Scientific instruments;Data and information visualization;Medical equipment stubs,5,20,10 April 2025,653,2,6,8,2025

For example, in medicine, the phenomenon ofhealthmight be operationalized by one or more indicators likebody mass indexortobacco smoking. As another example, in visual processing the presence of a certain object in the environment could be inferred by measuring specific features of the light it reflects.

Vedral examinesinformation theoryand proposesinformationas the most fundamental building block of reality. He argues what a useful framework this is for viewing all natural andphysical phenomena. In building out this framework the books touches upon the origin of information, the idea ofentropy, the roots of this thinking inthermodynamics, the replication of DNA, development ofsocial networks,quantumbehaviour at the micro and macro level, and the very role ofindeterminismin the universe. The book finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The ideas address concepts related to the nature ofparticles, time,determinism, and of reality itself.",2010 non-fiction books;Science books;Popular science books;Reality,0,76,5 December 2024,1525,1,17,4,2024

The term telecoupling was first coined byJianguo Liuas an evolution of the termteleconnection. While teleconnection makes reference to atmospheric sciences only, telecoupling references the integration of multiple scientific disciplines includingsocial science,environmental science,natural science, andsystems science.[2]The integration of these dynamic fields of science is what allows the telecoupling framework to comprehensively analyze distal connections that have been previously understudied and unacknowledged.",Scientific terminology;Earth sciences,16,73,23 May 2025,2533,8,16,46,2025

The aim of the expeditions was to measure thegravitational deflectionof starlight passing near the Sun.[1]The value of this deflection had been predicted byAlbert Einsteinin a 1911 paper; however, this initial prediction turned out not to be correct because it was based on an incomplete theory of general relativity. Einstein later improved his prediction after finalizing his theory in 1915 and obtaining the solution to his equations byKarl Schwarzschild. Following the return of the expeditions, the results were presented by Eddington to theRoyal Societyof London[2]and, after some deliberation, were accepted.

Scientia potentia est,"The phrase ""scientia potentia est"" (or ""scientia est potentia"" or also ""scientia potestas est"") is aLatinaphorismmeaning ""knowledge is power"", commonly attributed toSir Francis Bacon. The expression ""ipsa scientia potestas est"" ('knowledge itself is power') occurs in Bacon'sMeditationes Sacrae(1597). The exact phrase ""scientia potentia est"" (knowledge is power) was written for the first time in the 1668 version ofLeviathanbyThomas Hobbes, who was a secretary to Bacon as a young man. The related phrase ""sapientia est potentia"" is often translated as ""wisdom is power"".[1]In the modern and contemporary inquiries of the proposition,Stephen GillfurtheredRobert Cox's deconstructive statement on theontologyof knowledge, with anobjective epistemologicalstatement that ""any theory of knowledge production needs to have a power dimension"".[2]",Aphorisms;Knowledge;Latin words and phrases;Quotations from science;Quotations from literature;16th-century neologisms;17th-century neologisms;16th-century quotations;17th-century quotations;Power (social and political) concepts;Francis Bacon;Thomas Hobbes,13,68,1 June 2025,1244,4,11,28,2024

HLA are not typical antigens, like those found on surface ofinfectious agents. HLAs arealloantigens, they vary from individual to individual as a result of genetic differences.
An organ called thethymusis responsible for ensuring that anyT-cellsthat attack self proteins are not allowed to live. In essence, every individual's immune system is tuned to the specific set of HLA and self proteins produced by that individual; where this goes awry is when tissues are transferred to another person. Since individuals almost always have different ""banks"" of HLAs, the immune system of the recipient recognizes the transplanted tissue as non-self and destroys the foreign tissue, leading totransplant rejection. It was through the realization of this that HLAs were discovered.",Scientific terminology,21,172,28 September 2024,4636,14,16,45,2024

Preference test,"Apreference testis an experiment in which animals are allowed free access to multiple environments which differ in one or more ways.  Various aspects of the animal's behaviour can be measured with respect to the alternative environments, such as latency and frequency of entry, duration of time spent, range of activities observed, or relative consumption of a goal object in the environment. These measures can be recorded either by the experimenter or by motion detecting software.[1]Strength of preference can be inferred by the magnitude of the difference in the response, but see ""Advantages and disadvantages"" below. Statistical testing is used to determine whether observed differences in such measures support the conclusion that preference or aversion has occurred.   Prior to testing, the animals are usually given the opportunity to explore the environments tohabituateand reduce the effects of novelty.",Animal cognition;Animal intelligence;Animal testing;Animal welfare;Ethology;Scientific method,13,51,14 April 2025,553,1,16,31,2025

Isotope dilution,"Isotope dilution analysisis a method of determining the quantity of chemical substances. In its most simple conception, the method of isotope dilution comprises the addition of known amounts of isotopically enriched substance to the analyzed sample. Mixing of the isotopic standard with the sample effectively ""dilutes"" the isotopic enrichment of the standard and this forms the basis for the isotope dilution method. Isotope dilution is classified as a method ofinternal standardisation, because the standard (isotopically enriched form of analyte) is added directly to the sample. In addition, unlike traditional analytical methods which rely on signal intensity, isotope dilution employs signal ratios. Owing to both of these advantages, the method of isotope dilution is regarded among chemistry measurement methods of the highest metrological standing.[1]",Scientific method;Scientific techniques;Laboratory techniques,15,111,5 May 2024,1396,20,11,41,2024

There are some similarmethods of Western scienceincluding (but not limited to): observation, prediction, interpretation, and questioning.[5]There are also some areas in which Western science and Indigenous science differ. Indigenous knowledge is place and case-specific and does not attempt to label or generalize natural processes.[6]Western science strives to find commonalities and theories that can be applied to all areas, such asNewton’s Laws of Physics. This is because most Indigenous knowledge stems from the relationship humans have with their environment, which is passed down through stories or is discovered through observation.[7]Western knowledge takes a different approach by isolating targets to study, splitting them from their surroundings and making sets of assumptions and theories.Communityis a larger aspect of Indigenous science, and conclusions are shared through oral tradition and family knowledge, whereas most Western science research is published in a journal specific to that scientific field, and may restrict access to various papers.[7]",Oral tradition;History of science;Traditional knowledge;Indigenous culture,80,189,2 June 2025,2021,2,11,127,2025

Protocols are written whenever it is desirable to standardize a laboratory method to ensure successfulreplicationof results by others in the same laboratory or by other laboratories.[1][2]Additionally, and by extension, protocols have the advantage of facilitating the assessment of experimental results throughpeer review.[3]In addition to detailed procedures, equipment, and instruments, protocols will also contain study objectives, reasoning for experimental design, reasoning for chosen sample sizes, safety precautions, and how results were calculated and reported, including statistical analysis and any rules for predefining and documenting excluded data to avoid bias.[2]",Design of experiments;Good practice;Research;Scientific method,20,83,19 March 2025,772,2,4,33,2025
Scientific priority,"Inscience,priorityis the credit given to the individual or group of individuals who first made the discovery or proposed the theory.

Thus, between two or more independent discoverers, the first to publish is the legitimate winner. Hence, the tradition is often referred to as thepriority rule, the procedure of which is nicely summed up in a phrase ""publish or perish"", because there are no second prizes.[1]In a way, the race to be first inspires risk-taking that can lead to scientific breakthroughs which is beneficial to the society (such as discovery ofmalaria transmission,DNA,HIV, etc.). On the other hand, it can create unhealthy competition and incentives to publish low-quality findings (e.g., quantity over quality[2][3]or committingscientific misconduct), which can lead to an unreliable published literature and harm scientific progress.[4][5][6]",Scientific method,9,181,23 February 2025,426,2,5,23,2025

TheNew England Journal of Medicineresponded to the Feng and Casadevall editorial with a statement criticizing it for only considering papers with abstracts. The statement argued that because most articles published in each issue of theJournaldo not have abstracts, the journal's retraction index appeared artificially high.[3]They did not identify a mechanism for why this relationship might exist, but suggested that it might be because researchers are more willing to cut corners to get a paper published in a higher-impact journal.[4]",Academic publishing;Science stubs,4,24,28 May 2025,217,1,1,11,2025
