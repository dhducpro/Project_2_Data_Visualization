Science on Tap,"Science on Tap is the social-cultural initiative of Yivsam Azgad, head of the Media Department and art curator of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. 
The project began in 2010, under the title Beer, Science, and Fun, as a gesture to the city of Rehovot on its 120th anniversary.[1][2] In this framework, some 35 scientists and graduate students went to bars and pubs in Rehovot to talk with the patrons about open questions in science and the newest advances on the forefront of global science. On the same night, research students went to the city center and led a “science comics” session for children in which they created their own science comics, inspired by the Nano Comics series[3] put out by the Weizmann Institute of Science and edited by Yivsam Azgad. 
This initiative was highly successful and was covered by the media in Israel and the world. The scientists, artists, and politicians posed a challenge to the organizers: To reproduce this success in Tel Aviv. 
In response to the challenge, Azgad decided, with the support of the Weizmann Institute of Science president, Prof. Daniel Zajfman, to organize the event in Tel Aviv under a new name: Science on Tap. This event, preceded by a creative ad campaign, included the participation of 70 scientists from the Weizmann Institute of Science speaking in different bars, all at the same time, with free entrance for all. The wild success of this venture led to a significant change in the entertainment culture in Tel Aviv in particular and in Israel in general. Dozens of similar projects, all with the “on Tap” format, (Doctors on Tap, Law on Tap, Knesset Members on Tap, Stock Market on Tap, etc.) were introduced. Similar events have also been put on in London, Boston, Panama City and other places around the world. 
Science on Tap is an annual event in Tel Aviv[4] and is conducted jointly by the Weizmann Institute of Science, Time Out Tel Aviv magazine,[5][6] and often the Tel Aviv municipality.

History and naming of human leukocyte antigens,"Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) began as a list of antigens identified as a result of transplant rejection. The antigens were initially identified by categorizing and performing massive statistical analyses on interactions between blood types.[1] This process is based upon the principle of serotypes. HLA are not typical antigens, like those found on surface of infectious agents. HLAs are alloantigens, they vary from individual to individual as a result of genetic differences.
An organ called the thymus is responsible for ensuring that any T-cells that attack self proteins are not allowed to live. In essence, every individual's immune system is tuned to the specific set of HLA and self proteins produced by that individual; where this goes awry is when tissues are transferred to another person. Since individuals almost always have different ""banks"" of HLAs, the immune system of the recipient recognizes the transplanted tissue as non-self and destroys the foreign tissue, leading to transplant rejection. It was through the realization of this that HLAs were discovered.",Scientific terminology,21,333,28-Sep-24,4636,14,16,45,2024

In situ,"In situ[a] is a Latin phrase meaning 'in place' or 'on site', derived from in ('in') and situ (ablative of situs, lit. 'place').[3] The term refers to the examination or occurrence of a process within its original context, without relocation. The term is widely used across disciplines to denote methods, observations, or interventions carried out in their natural or intended environment. By contrast, ex situ methods involve the removal or displacement of materials, specimens, or processes for study, preservation, or modification in a controlled setting, often at the cost of contextual integrity. The earliest known use of in situ in the English language dates back to the mid-17th century. In scientific literature, its usage increased from the late 19th century onward, initially in medicine and engineering.",Latin words and phrases;Latin legal terminology;Latin biological phrases;Latin medical words and phrases;Animal test conditions;Scientific terminology,4,1133,26-Apr-25,4206,7,11,211,2025

Knoop hardness test,"The Knoop hardness test /kəˈnuːp/ is a microhardness test – a test for mechanical hardness used particularly for very brittle materials or thin sheets, where only a small indentation may be made for testing purposes. A pyramidal diamond point is pressed into the polished surface of the test material with a known (often 100 g) load, for a specified dwell time, and the resulting indentation is measured using a microscope. The geometry of this indenter is an extended pyramid with the length to width ratio being 7:1 and respective face angles are 172 degrees for the long edge and 130  degrees for the short edge. The depth of the indentation can be approximated as 1/30 of the long dimension.[1] The Knoop hardness HK or KHN is then given by the formula:",Hardness tests,3,40,19-Mar-25,272,3,3,5,2023

Neutron embrittlement,"Neutron embrittlement, sometimes more broadly radiation embrittlement, is the embrittlement of various materials due to the action of neutrons. This is primarily seen in nuclear reactors, where the release of high-energy neutrons causes the long-term degradation of the reactor materials. The embrittlement is caused by the microscopic movement of atoms that are hit by the neutrons; this same action also gives rise to neutron-induced swelling causing materials to grow in size, and the Wigner effect causing energy buildup in certain materials that can lead to sudden releases of energy.",Materials degradation;Neutron;Scientific terminology;Nuclear and atomic physics stubs,3,49,19-Feb-24,371,1,3,8,2024

Decoding Reality,"Decoding Reality: The Universe as Quantum Information is a popular science book by Vlatko Vedral published by Oxford University Press in 2010. Vedral examines information theory and proposes information as the most fundamental building block of reality. He argues what a useful framework this is for viewing all natural and physical phenomena. In building out this framework the books touches upon the origin of information, the idea of entropy, the roots of this thinking in thermodynamics, the replication of DNA, development of social networks, quantum behaviour at the micro and macro level, and the very role of indeterminism in the universe. The book finishes by considering the answer to the ultimate question: where did all of the information in the Universe come from? The ideas address concepts related to the nature of particles, time, determinism, and of reality itself.",2010 non-fiction books;Science books;Popular science books;Reality,0,99,5-Dec-24,1525,1,17,4,2024

Life Science Library,"The Life Science Library is a series of hardbound books published by Time Life between 1963 and 1967. Each of the 26 volumes explores a major topic of the natural sciences. They are intended for, and written at a level appropriate to, an educated lay readership. In each volume, the text of each of eight chapters is followed by a ""Picture Essay"" lavishly illustrating the subject of the preceding chapter. They were available in a monthly subscription from Life magazine. Each volume takes complex scientific concepts and provides explanations that can be easily understood. For example, Albert Einstein's theory of relativity is explained in a cartoon about a spy drama involving a train traveling very close to the speed of light; probability is explained with poker hands; and the periodic table of the elements is conveyed with common household items. Although progress has overtaken much of the material in the more than 50 years since their publication, the series' explanations of basic science and the history of discovery remain valid. The consulting editors of the series are microbiologist René Dubos, physicist Henry Margenau, and physicist and novelist C. P. Snow.",Science books;Time Life book series;Biology book stubs,0,63,3-Nov-22,228,2,1,0,2022
"Little Science, Big Science","Little Science, Big Science is a book of collected lectures given by Derek J. De Solla Price, first published in 1963. The book presents the 1962 Brookhaven National Laboratory Pegram Lectures, a series of lectures dedicated to discussing science and its place in society. Price's goal in the lectures is to outline what it may look like for science to be analysed scientifically, by applying methods of measuring, hypothesizing, and deriving to science itself. With this goal in mind, he sets out to define quasi-mathematically how the shape and size of science has shifted from ""small science"" to ""big science"" in a historical and sociological way. Price presents a quantification of science as a measurable entity via an analogy to thermodynamics, conceptualizing science like a gas with individual molecules possessing individual velocities and interactions, a total volume, and general properties or laws.",1963 non-fiction books;Science books;Books of lectures,20,73,10-May-24,1866,1,5,8,2024

people who are totally new to the subject, and a good blend of storytelling and technical writing.

He believed that when read alongside sacred scripture, the ""book"" and the study of God's creations would lead to a knowledge of God himself. This type of revelation is often referred to as a general revelation. The concept corresponds to the early Greek philosophical belief that humans, as part of a coherent universe, are capable of understanding the design of the natural world through reason. Philosophers, theologians, and scholars frequently deploy the concept.

Fermentation theory,"In biochemistry, fermentation theory refers to the historical study of models of natural fermentation processes, especially alcoholic and lactic acid fermentation. Notable contributors to the theory include Justus Von Liebig and Louis Pasteur, the latter of whom developed a purely microbial basis for the fermentation process based on his experiments. Pasteur's work on fermentation later led to his development of the germ theory of disease, which put the concept of spontaneous generation to rest.[1] Although the fermentation process had been used extensively throughout history prior to the origin of Pasteur's prevailing theories, the underlying biological and chemical processes were not fully understood. In the contemporary, fermentation is used in the production of various alcoholic beverages, foodstuffs, and medications.[2][3]",Obsolete medical theories;Microbiology;History of science;Biology theories;Metabolism;Louis Pasteur,12,176,23-Oct-24,1500,4,6,10,2024

Hellenophilia,"Hellenophilia is the idea that all western science began in Greek tradition.[1] This is discussed in length by David Pingree in his address to colleagues. Hellenophilia is a way of thought that allows those who look into the history of science to be blinded to science born in other cultures. Pingree states, in explanation of the term that ""a Hellenophile suffers from a form of madness that blinds him or her to historical truth"" (Pingree, 1992, p. 554) He continues by explaining the main symptoms of Hellenophilia ""the first of these is that the Greeks invented science; the second is that they discovered a way to truth, the scientific method, that we are now successfully following; the third is that the only real sciences are those that began in Greece; and the fourth (and last?) is that the true definition of science is just that which scientists happen to be doing now, following a method or methods adumbrated by the Greeks, but never fully understood or utilized by them"" (Pingree, 1992, p. 555).",Admiration of foreign cultures;Greek nationalism;History of science;History of science stubs,2,20,13-Jan-24,308,1,1,0,2024

Indigenous science,"Indigenous science is the application and intersection of Indigenous knowledge and science. This field is based on careful observation of the environment, and through experimentation. It is a holistic field, informed by physical, social, mental and cultural knowledge.[1] When applied to ecology and the environment, it can be sometimes termed traditional ecological knowledge.[2][3][4] Indigenous science involves the knowledge systems and practices of Indigenous peoples, which are rooted in their cultural traditions and relationships to their indigenous context. There are some similar methods of Western science including (but not limited to): observation, prediction, interpretation, and questioning.[5] There are also some areas in which Western science and Indigenous science differ. Indigenous knowledge is place and case-specific and does not attempt to label or generalize natural processes.[6] Western science strives to find commonalities and theories that can be applied to all areas, such as Newton’s Laws of Physics. This is because most Indigenous knowledge stems from the relationship humans have with their environment, which is passed down through stories or is discovered through observation.[7] Western knowledge takes a different approach by isolating targets to study, splitting them from their surroundings and making sets of assumptions and theories. Community is a larger aspect of Indigenous science, and conclusions are shared through oral tradition and family knowledge, whereas most Western science research is published in a journal specific to that scientific field, and may restrict access to various papers.[7]",Oral tradition;History of science;Traditional knowledge;Indigenous culture,80,511,3-Jan-25,2021,2,11,124,2025

Materialism controversy,"The materialism controversy (German: Materialismusstreit) was a debate in the mid-19th century regarding the implications for current worldviews of the natural sciences. In the 1840s, a new type of materialism was developed, influenced by the methodological advancements in biology and the decline of idealistic philosophy. This form of materialism aimed to explain humans in scientific terms. The controversy revolved around whether the findings of natural sciences were compatible with the concepts of an immaterial soul, a personal God and free will. Additionally, the debate focused on the epistemological requirements of a materialist/mechanist worldview.[1]",Scientific controversies;19th century in philosophy;Philosophy of biology;History of science;Materialism,51,424,9-Apr-25,5242,11,19,21,2025

An object placed at the focus of one mirror would have heat and light reflected by the mirror and focused. An object at the focus of the counterpart mirror would do the same. Placing a hot object at one focus and a thermometer at the other would register an increase in temperature on the thermometer.

Because the RI can serve as an intrinsic imaging contrast for transparent or phase objects, measurements of RI tomograms can provide label-free quantitative imaging of microscopic phase objects. In order to measure 3-D RI tomogram of samples, HT employs the principle of holographic imaging and inverse scattering. Typically, multiple 2D holographic images of a sample are measured at various illumination angles, employing the principle of interferometric imaging. Then, a 3D RI tomogram of the sample is reconstructed from these multiple 2D holographic images by inversely solving light scattering in the sample.",Imaging;Scientific instruments,22,249,16-Sep-24,873,2,13,91,2024
Kymograph,"A kymograph (from Greek κῦμα, swell or wave + γραφή, writing; also called a kymographion) is a type of two-dimensional plot that represents spatial position or signal intensity over time. In its modern usage, a kymograph is typically a space–time plot used in fields such as microscopy, cell biology, and speech science to track dynamic processes. These plots are generated by extracting intensity values along a predefined path across sequential image frames. The resulting image reduces the dimension to show time on one axis and sequential spatial information on the other. Using this technique allows for the visualization of dynamics within the image sequence, often by measuring the resulting slope of lines or streaks. This allows researchers to quantify velocity and directionality of movement, especially in applications like mitochondrial transport, vesicle trafficking, or vocal fold vibration. Although they reduce spatial information to a one-dimensional line, kymographs offer high temporal resolution and are often used alongside or in place of particle tracking techniques.",Medical imaging;Scientific techniques;Scientific instruments;Data and information visualization;Medical equipment stubs,5,50,10-Apr-25,653,2,6,8,2025

These atoms effuse out of a hole in the oven with average speeds on the order of hundreds of m/s and large velocity distributions (due to their high temperature).  The Zeeman slower is attached close to where the hot atoms exit the oven and are used to slow them to less than 10 m/s (slowing) with a very small velocity spread (cooling).",Atomic physics;Cooling technology;Scientific instruments,11,141,19-Mar-25,1271,28,5,36,2025

Science of science policy,"Science of science policy (SoSP) is an emerging interdisciplinary research area that seeks to develop theoretical and empirical models of the scientific enterprise. This scientific basis can be used to help government, and society in general, make better R&D management decisions by establishing a scientifically rigorous, quantitative basis from which policy makers and researchers may assess the impacts of the nation's scientific and engineering enterprise, improve their understanding of its dynamics, and assess the likely outcomes. Examples of research in the science of science policy include models to understand the production of science, qualitative, quantitative and computational methods to estimate the impact of science, and processes for choosing from alternative science portfolios.[1]: 5",Politics of science;Science policy;Metascience,1,180,28-Aug-23,411,2,5,2,2023

Evidence-based practice,"Evidence-based practice is the idea that occupational practices ought to be based on scientific evidence. The movement towards evidence-based practices attempts to encourage and, in some instances, require professionals and other decision-makers to pay more attention to evidence to inform their decision-making. The goal of evidence-based practice is to eliminate unsound or outdated practices in favor of more-effective ones by shifting the basis for decision making from tradition, intuition, and unsystematic experience to firmly grounded scientific research.[1] The proposal has been controversial, with some arguing that results may not specialize to individuals as well as traditional practices.[2]",Evidence-based practices;Health care quality;Scientific method,46,426,22-Sep-24,1878,3,13,79,2024
Experimenter's regress,"In science, experimenter's regress refers to a loop of dependence between theory and evidence. In order to judge whether a new piece of evidence is correct we rely on theory-based predictions, and to judge the value of competing theories we rely on existing evidence.

A test outcome that could have and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis.  A test outcome that could have, but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory.

Mixing of the isotopic standard with the sample effectively ""dilutes"" the isotopic enrichment of the standard and this forms the basis for the isotope dilution method. Isotope dilution is classified as a method of internal standardisation, because the standard (isotopically enriched form of analyte) is added directly to the sample. In addition, unlike traditional analytical methods which rely on signal intensity, isotope dilution employs signal ratios. Owing to both of these advantages, the method of isotope dilution is regarded among chemistry measurement methods of the highest metrological standing.[1]",Scientific method;Scientific techniques;Laboratory techniques,15,203,5-May-24,1396,20,11,41,2024

Open-label trial,"An open-label trial, or open trial, is a type of clinical trial in which information is not withheld from trial participants.[1] In particular, both the researchers and participants know which treatment is being administered.[1] This contrasts with a double-blinded trial, where information is withheld both from the researchers and the participants to reduce bias.[2][3]",Design of experiments;Clinical trials;Scientific method;Research methods,5,129,14-Mar-23,115,0,1,12,2023
Open-notebook science,"Open-notebook science is the practice of making the entire primary record of a research project publicly available online as it is recorded. This involves placing the personal, or laboratory, notebook of the researcher online along with all raw and processed data, and any associated material, as this material is generated. The approach may be summed up by the slogan 'no insider information'. It is the logical extreme of transparent approaches to research and explicitly includes the making available of failed, less significant, and otherwise unpublished experiments; so called 'dark data'.[1] The practice of open notebook science, although not the norm in the academic community, has gained significant recent attention in the research[2][3] and general[1][4] media as part of a general trend towards more open approaches in research practice and publishing. Open notebook science can therefore be described as part of a wider open science movement that includes the advocacy and adoption of open access publication, open data, crowdsourcing data, and citizen science. It is inspired in part by the success of open-source software[5] and draws on many of its ideas.",Open data;Notebooks;Scientific method;Open science,66,536,13-Mar-25,1118,0,12,101,2025
Operationalization,"In research design, especially in psychology, social sciences, life sciences and physics, operationalization or operationalisation is a process of defining the measurement of a phenomenon which is not directly measurable, though its existence is inferred from other phenomena. Operationalization thus defines a fuzzy concept so as to make it clearly distinguishable, measurable, and understandable by empirical observation. In a broader sense, it defines the extension of a concept—describing what is and is not an instance of that concept. For example, in medicine, the phenomenon of health might be operationalized by one or more indicators like body mass index or tobacco smoking. As another example, in visual processing the presence of a certain object in the environment could be inferred by measuring specific features of the light it reflects. In these examples, the phenomena are difficult to directly observe and measure because they are general/abstract (as in the example of health) or they are latent (as in the example of the object). Operationalization helps infer the existence, and some elements of the extension, of the phenomena of interest by means of some observable and measurable effects they have.",Social sciences;Scientific method;Epistemology of science,23,309,3-Apr-25,1616,3,10,25,2025

These measures can be recorded either by the experimenter or by motion detecting software.[1] Strength of preference can be inferred by the magnitude of the difference in the response, but see ""Advantages and disadvantages"" below. Statistical testing is used to determine whether observed differences in such measures support the conclusion that preference or aversion has occurred.

There are also analytical replicates which is when an exact copy of a sample is analyzed, such as a cell, organism or molecule, using exactly the same procedure. This is done in order to check for analytical error. In the absence of this type of error replicates should yield the same result. However, analytical replicates are not independent and cannot be used in tests of the hypothesis because they are still the same sample.[1][2]",Biological processes;Measurement;Scientific method;Tests;Validity (statistics);Biology stubs,2,25,1-Nov-23,139,1,2,5,2023

Thus, between two or more independent discoverers, the first to publish is the legitimate winner. Hence, the tradition is often referred to as the priority rule, the procedure of which is nicely summed up in a phrase ""publish or perish"", because there are no second prizes.[1] In a way, the race to be first inspires risk-taking that can lead to scientific breakthroughs which is beneficial to the society (such as discovery of malaria transmission, DNA, HIV, etc.).

It maintained a certain ethics of precision and observation, which combined scientific field work with the sensitivity and aesthetic ideals of the age of Romanticism.[1]  Like Romanticism in science, it was rather popular in the 19th century. The term was coined by Susan Faye Cannon in 1978.[2][3]
The example of Humboldt's life and his writings allowed him to reach out beyond the academic community with his natural history and address a wider audience with popular science aspects.

Marine counterparts of land creatures,"The idea that there are specific marine counterparts to land creatures,[1] inherited from the writers on natural history in Antiquity, was firmly believed in Islam[2] and in Medieval Europe. It is exemplified by the creatures represented in the medieval animal encyclopedias called bestiaries, and in the parallels drawn in the moralising attributes attached to each. ""The creation was a mathematical diagram drawn in parallel lines,"" T. H. White said a propos the bestiary he translated. ""Things did not only have a moral they often had physical counterparts in other strata. There was a horse in the land and a sea-horse in the sea. For that matter there was probably a Pegasus in heaven"".[3] The idea of perfect analogies in the fauna of land and sea was considered part of the perfect symmetry[4] of the Creator's plan, offered as the ""book of nature"" to mankind, for which a text could be found in Job:",Obsolete biology theories;Natural history,12,67,11-Dec-24,1010,0,1,2,2024

Naturhistorieselskabet,"Naturhistorieselskabet - the Society for Natural History - was a private society that was the only institution to offer education in natural history in Denmark in the late 18th century. The spirit of the Age of Enlightenment and an escalating agricultural crisis, led the king and the Danish elite to call foreign experts on economy, including botany and silviculture, to the country. The autonomous University of Copenhagen, on the other hand, was reluctant to employ foreign experts in little-established disciplines. Naturhistorieselskabet was formed in 1788 in order to ensure education in botany, zoology and mineralogy based on private funds. For example, Martin Vahl lectured in botany. After the appointment in 1795 of a professor in geology and in 1797 one in botany, the society gradually lost its importance. It was soon abolished and its collections donated to the state (much later united with the university collections).",Natural history;Scientific societies based in Denmark;History of education in Denmark;Natural history societies;Danish organization stubs;History of science stubs,0,32,11-Aug-23,196,2,1,0,2023
Peterson Identification System,"The Peterson Identification System is a practical method for the field identification of animals, plants and other natural phenomena. It was devised by ornithologist Roger Tory Peterson in 1934 for the first of his series of Field Guides[1] (See Peterson Field Guides.) Peterson devised his system ""so that live birds could be identified readily at a distance by their 'field marks' without resorting to the bird-in-hand characters that the early collectors relied on. During the last half century the binocular and the spotting scope have replaced the shotgun.""[2] As such, it both reflected and contributed to awareness of the emerging early environmental movement. Another application of this system was made when Roger Tory Peterson was enlisted in the US Army Corps of Engineers from 1943 to 1945. “...plane identification—the aircraft spotting technique—was based on Roger’s bird identification method-the Peterson system.”.[3]",Biological literature;Natural history;Wild animals identification;Ecology stubs,3,38,15-Oct-22,256,2,3,6,2022

Magmatic water,"Magmatic water, also known as juvenile water, is an aqueous phase in equilibrium with minerals that have been dissolved by magma deep within the Earth's crust and is released to the atmosphere during a volcanic eruption. It plays a key role in assessing the crystallization of igneous rocks, particularly silicates, as well as the rheology and evolution of magma chambers. Magma is composed of minerals, crystals and volatiles in varying relative natural abundance.[1] Magmatic differentiation varies significantly based on various factors, most notably the presence of water.[2] An abundance of volatiles within magma chambers decreases viscosity and leads to the formation of minerals bearing halogens, including chloride and hydroxide groups. In addition, the relative abundance of volatiles varies within basaltic, andesitic, and rhyolitic magma chambers, leading to some volcanoes being exceedingly more explosive than others. Magmatic water is practically insoluble in silicate melts but has demonstrated the highest solubility within rhyolitic melts. An abundance of magmatic water has been shown to lead to high-grade deformation, as a result of altering the composition of hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry (δ2H) and stable oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) within host rocks.",Igneous petrology;Geochemistry;Water;Scientific problems,13,232,8-Apr-25,1127,2,10,30,2025

Tyranny of numbers,"The tyranny of numbers was a problem faced in the 1960s by computer engineers.  Engineers were unable to increase the performance of their designs due to the huge number of components involved. In theory, every component needed to be wired to every other component (or at least many other components) and were typically strung and soldered by hand. In order to improve performance, more components would be needed, and it seemed that future designs would consist almost entirely of wiring.",Computer engineering;Early computers;Quotations from science;1950s neologisms,1,77,31-Jan-25,700,8,3,16,2025

Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program,"The Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Project (BPP) was a research project funded by NASA from 1996 to 2002 to study various proposals for revolutionary methods of spacecraft propulsion that would require breakthroughs in physics before they could be realized.[1][2] The project ended in 2002, when the Advanced Space Transportation Program was reorganized and all speculative research (less than Technology readiness level 3) was cancelled.[2]
During its six years of operational funding, this program received a total investment of $1.2 million.",Interstellar travel;Spacecraft propulsion;Scientific speculation;Warp drive theory,17,200,5-Dec-23,707,0,7,41,2023

Hypothetical types of biochemistry,"Several forms of biochemistry are agreed to be scientifically viable but are not proven to exist at this time.[2] The kinds of living organisms currently known on Earth all use carbon compounds for basic structural and metabolic functions, water as a solvent, and DNA or RNA to define and control their form. If life exists on other planets or moons it may be chemically similar, though it is also possible that there are organisms with quite different chemistries[3] –  for instance, involving other classes of carbon compounds, compounds of another element, or another solvent in place of water.",Astrobiology;Science fiction themes;Biological hypotheses;Scientific speculation,101,1628,22-Apr-25,4184,20,27,214,2025
United States gravity control propulsion research,"American interest in gravity control propulsion research intensified during the early 1950s. Literature from that period used the terms anti-gravity, anti-gravitation, baricentric, counterbary, electrogravitics (eGrav), G-projects, gravitics, gravity control, and gravity propulsion.[1][2] Their publicized goals were to discover and develop technologies and theories for the manipulation of gravity or gravity-like fields for propulsion.[3] Although general relativity theory appeared to prohibit anti-gravity propulsion, several programs were funded to develop it through gravitation research from 1955 to 1974. The names of many contributors to general relativity and those of the golden age of general relativity have appeared among documents about the institutions that had served as the theoretical research components of those programs.[4][5][6] Since its emergence in the 1950s, the existence of the related gravity control propulsion research has not been a subject of controversy for aerospace writers, critics, and conspiracy theory advocates alike, but their rationale, effectiveness, and longevity have been the objects of contested views.",Anti-gravity;Aerospace engineering organizations;Research and development in the United States;United States government secrecy;Science and technology-related conspiracy theories;History of physics;History of science and technology in the United States;Spacecraft propulsion;Scientific speculation;Science fiction themes;Fringe physics;Ufology;Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,60,447,12-Apr-25,3051,0,20,36,2025
